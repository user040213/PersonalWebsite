### Personal Website
![](Home.png "Hero/Landing Page")
## Frameworks/Techstack
Used MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node)
Frontend code has been modified so that the backend portion is not needed for easier hosting
The backend was used to fetch a database of projects and then post those onto the website under "Projects"
